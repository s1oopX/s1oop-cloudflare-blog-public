# s1oop Cloudflare Blog Public Copy

An Astro static blog designed for quiet long-form reading, deployed on Cloudflare Pages with optional Pages Functions for stats, comments, and private Markdown publishing.

Live site: <https://s1oop.bbroot.com>

## Repository Role

This is the sanitized public copy of the project. The private repository remains the source of truth for the live Cloudflare Pages deployment.

This copy does not include local secrets, deployment credentials, Cloudflare account state, build output, logs, or local development runtime folders.

## Features

- Astro static site generation.
- Markdown posts through Astro Content Collections.
- Dark archive-style visual system.
- Full archive, collection pages, search index, changelog, and article pages.
- Cloudflare Pages deployment from GitHub.
- Optional `/api/*` functions backed by `workers/api.js`.
- Optional private `/s1oop/admin` publishing flow when GitHub API credentials are configured.

## Tech Stack

- Astro 6
- TailwindCSS
- Cloudflare Pages
- Cloudflare Pages Functions
- Cloudflare KV, optional
- Wrangler, for Worker config validation and deployment tooling

## Local Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4322
```

`npm run dev` starts:

- Astro dev server on `127.0.0.1:4322`
- Local API server on `127.0.0.1:8787`

Astro proxies `/api/*` to the local API server, so local stats, comments, and admin checks behave like the deployed Pages Functions.

Split commands are also available:

```sh
npm run dev:astro
npm run dev:api
npm run dev:proxy
```

## Environment Variables

Copy the example file and fill local-only values:

```sh
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

`.dev.vars` is ignored by Git.

Required for private admin login:

```text
ADMIN_PASSWORD=...
```

Required only if `/s1oop/admin` should publish Markdown files back to your own GitHub repository:

```text
GITHUB_TOKEN=...
GITHUB_OWNER=...
GITHUB_REPO=...
GITHUB_BRANCH=main
CONTENT_DIR=content/posts
```

Optional:

```text
COMMENTS_ENABLED=false
SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

## Build

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The static output is written to `dist/`.

## Cloudflare Pages

The live site is deployed from the private source repository, not from this public copy.

Recommended Pages settings:

```text
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: dist
Production branch: main
Node.js version: 22
```

Pages Functions live in:

```text
functions/api/[[path]].js
```

That route delegates to:

```text
workers/api.js
```

`wrangler.jsonc` contains the standalone Worker configuration for validation and future direct Worker deployment.

## Content

Add posts under `content/posts/`:

```md
---
title: My Post
date: 2026-04-29
excerpt: Short summary.
tags:
  - Blog
draft: false
---

Post body.
```

Images can be placed under `public/images/posts/` and referenced from Markdown with absolute public paths.

## Repository Notes

- The public blog is static-first.
- Public comments are disabled by default.
- Visit stats work without KV, but are not persisted until `BLOG_KV` is bound.
- The admin publishing API requires GitHub credentials and should only be enabled for trusted deployments.
- This public repository is safe to inspect and fork, but it is not connected to the owner's production deployment.
